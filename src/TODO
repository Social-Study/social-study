Branding:
  ☐ Design a logo / titlebar icon
  ☐ Think of better slogan.

Database Design:
  ☐ Do I need to store a user's photURL and other info in the firestore for other users to see it?

General:
  ☐ Convert Project to new Element UI Library
  ☐ Make sure the build bundle size is not too large.
  ☐ Font-Awesome Icon Package Icons are not aligned properly

Routing:
  Bugs:
    ☐ User refreshes page after being redirected and it takes them back to landing, it should prevent them from seeing the landing while logged in

Dashboard:
  ☐ When you update your profile picture, you must refresh page to see it
    - Might have something to do with the photoURL being stored in auth not firestore

Prototype Presentation:
  ☐ Implement Study Groups
    ☐ Figure out how routing will work
  ☐ Implement a Study Group feature
    ☐ Flashcards
