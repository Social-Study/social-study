Figure out why I am getting a warning for the site being too large.
  Might have to change the imports on some of the packages/CSS

Finish up the landing page. Make the css work on mobile.
  - Sure how to handle the top login form
  - Need to make text size scale.

Each user account has:
  - Displayname
  - Profile Picture
  - Small description/bio
  - email change
  - password change

If the user refreshes the page once redirected, it takes them back to the landing page...
  Need to always redirect user if they are logged in

Figure out fix for Icon misalignment

Ask Dylan if he can design an application icon

Think of better slogan.
