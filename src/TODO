Figure out why I am getting a warning for the site being too large.
  Might have to change the imports on some of the packages/CSS

Finish up the landing page. Make the css work on mobile.
  - Sure how to handle the top login form
  - Need to make text size scale.

Each user account has:
  - Displayname
  - Profile Picture
  - Small description/bio
  - list of study groups

If the user refreshes the page once redirected, it takes them back to the landing page...
  Need to always redirect user if they are logged in

Figure out fix for Icon misalignment

Ask Dylan if he can design an application icon

Think of better slogan.

When the user updates their profile picture, the state isn't changed for some reason.
Even though the displayName update triggers it?

Figure out how to keep a variable in sync with firebase.

Decide how I want the user accounts to work, I think I need to store every user's
public data in the firebase store so that other users can see it...
