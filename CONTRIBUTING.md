## Adding new features
The `master` branch is the final product. Never write directly to it.

### To start developing:

1. Create a new branch from the development branch that starts with your initials and includes what the purpose of the branch is.
 - ex) `eb__dashboard`
 - The development branch is to remain working and mostly bug-free. Do not try to pull any changes that break the system.
1. Write code, and only commit when you are finished with a feature. Do not commit just to save changes before stopping work the time being. Commits should only be features.
1. Once you are done with the feature, push it to your branch on GitLab.
1. Create a pull request that requests your feature to be added to the development branch.
 - Include details such as what you changed and if anything is not working properly. 
  - Can include screenshots as well
 - You can tag another team member to review it before they approve the pull request.
1. The team will meet and review the development branch to decide if we want to pull it to the master branch.
