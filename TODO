Branding:
  ☐ Design a logo / titlebar icon
  ☐ Think of better slogan.
  ☐ The new titlebar icon only apply to the google redirect popup window but now the title bar?
  ☐ Find better flashcard sidebar icon
  ☐ Improve color design. Not sure about the gradients the more I work with it.
    - Seems too glaring and random. We need a simpler color pallete of a few select colors...

Possible Features (Time Permitting):
  ☐ Maybe allow users to upload pdfs and save notes to their own documents
  ☐ Video/Audio Chat with WebRTC

General:
  ☐ Go through and error check all inputs where necessary
    - Cannot apply the blur effect because it requires backdrop-filter that is only available in certain browsers
  ☐ Make sure that each page that loads from firebase has error checking
    ☐ Should display an error message if the firebase load fails
    ☐ User's should be limited to what they are permitted to access..
  ☐ Go through and improve the colors and design as we go. There are some things that I think are ugly, design wise.

Components Needed:
  ☐ Notification popup
    Currently using vue-notifications but would be willing to switch to something better.
  ☐ Modal that can be used for all other modals.
  ☐ Custom designed switch component
  ☐ Create add button card item

Firebase Functions File:
  ☐ Remove expired invite codes
  ☐ Downscale images?
  ☐ Remove messages once size reaches > 1000 messages
  ☐ Function to increment message counter of the document everytime a new document is created
  ☐ Generate a boilerplate note when a new user joins the study group? It should let them know the full functionality of markdown and the syntax

Landing:
  ☐ Improve form validation

Notes:
  ☐ Make sure that other users cannot access notes they didn't create
  ☐ Find more markdown css themes
    ☐ Dark theme
  ☐ Figure out what I should limit the title length to
  ☐ Maybe extract the view component if we want to use it for aiding users in creating their flashcards.
  ☐ implement a note deletion feature so users can delete notes they don't want
  ☐ Autoscroll viewing content to match...
  Maybes:
    ☐ Allow users to create collections to manage their own notes?

Chat:
  ☐ Add a date display so that you can tell on what day the messages were sent
    Only show if I calculate the differences in times and find it to be over a certain threshold
  Maybes:
    ☐ Shadow around the left edge of chat sidebar
    ☐ Total number of messages indicator (Could either be total messages or unread messages...)
       Not sure how I would implement tracking unread messages

Known Bugs:
  ☐ Form validation is broken
    - May have to implement custom validation for the create page
    - Might be caused by not using a form. I'm just using vee-validate to validate input fields...
  ☐ On the study page, when you select next flashcard with the buttons. the spacebar doesn't work as intended

Vuex Store:
  ☐ Save the number of unread messages to the store.
    Reset the number when the user opens the chat sidebar

Homepage:
  ☐ Display an empty placeholder if the user doesn't have any recent notes or books.

Members Page:
  ☐ Add members list page sort filters
    - Joined Date, Alphabetical, etc...

Profile Settings:
  ☐ When I implement the account deletion make sure to remove the photos as well as the user account
  ☐ Automatically update to the file picker's picture so user can preview what it will look like

Side Bar:
  ☐ add more Study Group information (meeting time, location, extra info) possibly do this in a modal

NavBar:
  ☐ Redesign navbar to scale properly on all screen sizes. Employ the use of a custom flexbox setup that allows more flexibility
  ☐ Style the currently active group based on the route parameters

Create Study Group:
  ☐ Prevent user from clicking create and getting to copy code if they don't do all steps
  ☐ Add transitions to make it look nice
  ☐ Figure out how to center the content without using a fixed page size (94vh)
  ☐ Put a conditional on the meeting days and times. Ask "Does the have designated meeting days and times?"

Flashcards Collection:
  ☐ Figure out proper way to get the last row to the left instead of centering it.

Flashcards:
  ☐ Autofocus after using keybind to create a new flashcard

Animations / Transitions:
  Flashcard Study:
    ☐ Animations feel too fast and snappy.
  Create Page:
    ☐ Animation when steps indicator changes
    ☐ Animation when user navigates between cards
    ☐ Sequential loading animations when list are being displayed for the first time
      Show the icons appearing one after the other
