Branding:
  ☐ Design a logo / titlebar icon
  ☐ Think of better slogan.
  ☐ The new titlebar icon only apply to the google redirect popup window but now the title bar?
  ☐ PURPLE??????????????????????????????????????????????????????@critical
  ☐ Find better flashcard sidebar icon

Database Design:
  ☐ Decide if I should store each user's study groups in their profile as well as in the actual study group itself
  ☐ Figure out how to delete a code after 24 hours.
General:
  ☐ Not sure why the favicon is not showing???? @low
  ☐ Make sure the build bundle size is not too large. @low
  ☐ Go through an error check all inputs where necessary
  ☐ Create a universal notifaction popup, not like the homepage error notifcation but a bubble type.

  ☐ When the page content overflows downwards, only allow the page content to scroll not the sidebar or header @high
    Not exactly sure how to do this.
  ☐ find new animation library
  ☐ add dark blur effect to modals
  ☐ Maybe allow users to upload pdfs and save notes to their own documents

Components Needed:
  ☐ Notification popup
  ☐ Modal that can be used for all other modals.
  ☐ Custom designed switch component

Firebase Functions File:
  ☐ Generate Invite Code

Vuex Store:
  ☐ Only save the uid to local storage

Homepage:
  ☐ Add homepage option to list and remove active invite codes.
  ☐ Add more detail to Study Group cards in dropdown

Members Page:
  ☐ Add members list page sort filters
    - Joined Date, Alphabetical, etc...

Profile Settings:
  ☐ When I implement the account deletion make sure to remove the photos as well as the user account
  ☐ Automatically update to the file picker's picture so user can preview what it will look like

Routing:
  Bugs:
    ☐ Setup firebase auth to not allow users to see the page that aren't in the study group's auth list

Side Bar:
  ☐ add more Study Group information (meeting time, location, extra info) possibly do this in a modal

NavBar:
  ☐ Redesign navbar to scale properly on all screen sizes. Employ the use of a custom flexbox setup that allows more flexibility

Study Group:
  ☐ Show a study group settings modal only to the group owner to allow them to change the details after creation

Create Study Group:
  ☐ Prevent user from clicking create and getting to copy code if they don't do all steps
  ☐ Add transitions to make it look nice
    - Element is too opinionated, and it is a pain in the ass trying to override most of the defaults
    - It is also very large, > 1mb

Flashcards:
  ☐ Implement navigation animations
  ☐ Implement firebase functionality
  ☐ find a way to better indicate which side of the flashcard is currently displaying

Animations / Transitions:
  Create Page:
    ☐ Animation when steps indicator changes
    ☐ Animation when user navigates between cards
