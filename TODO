Branding:
  ☐ PURPLE Social Study icon for the favicon @high
  ☐ Think of better slogan.

General:
  ☐ Apply new transparency effects to all modal backgrounds @low
  ☐ Go through and error check all inputs where necessary
  ☐ Make sure that each page that loads from firebase has error checking
    ☐ Should display an error message if the firebase load fails
    ☐ User's should be limited to what they are permitted to access..
    - Sub-pages are pages that you are taken to after clicking a main page
    - Ex) Study-flashcard, take-quiz
  ☐ Paginate collection pages so they scale when more information is added.
  ☐ Not sure if I should save some things about the user's preferences to firebase
    - Collapsed or Open Sidebar
    - Collapsed or Open Chat
    - Chat notifications on. etc...
  ☐ Sequential loading animations when list are being displayed for the first time
       Every list is loading from firebase so there is a delay before the data is shown. Figure out how to get loading list to be animated 1-by-1 when shown for the first time
  ☐ Small QOL Features
    ☐ Always verify delete actions
  ☐ Update all date / time pickers to use new component library
  ☐ Do something with the extra study group info @high
    ☐ Show description when user tries to join the group...
  ☐ Confirmation email when signing up @high

Components Needed:
  ☐ Notification popup
    Currently using vue-notifications but would be willing to switch to something better.

Firebase Functions File:
  ☐ Improve functions file code to match requirements. Right now, there are some errors thrown but it works
  ☐ Downscale images?
  ☐ Remove messages once size reaches > 1000 messages
  ☐ Function to increment message counter of the document everytime a new document is created
  ☐ Generate a boilerplate note when a new user joins the study group? It should let them know the full functionality of markdown and the syntax

Modals:
  ☐ Improve modals with new design...

Group Settings:
  ☐ Update to match new design

Notes:
  ☐ Find more markdown css themes
    ☐ Dark theme
  ☐ Autoscroll viewing content to match...
  ☐ Scale the views to be on top of eachother when window width is too small
  ☐ Add a switch to show preview vs edit views...
  Maybes:
    ☐ Allow users to create collections to manage their own notes?

Chat:
  Maybes:
    ☐ Total number of messages indicator (Could either be total messages or unread messages...)
       Not sure how I would implement tracking unread messages
      - Maybe allow editing?
    ☐ Scroll down button when not at chat end?

Quiz:
  ☐ Add T/F question type
  ☐ Fix questions to match new design
  ☐ Fix Griffin's bug?
  ☐ Bug where submitting all correct answers shows as 0 correct...@critical

Known Bugs:
  ☐ Form validation is broken
    - May have to implement custom validation for the create page
    - Might be caused by not using a form. I'm just using vee-validate to validate input fields...
  FlashCard Study:
    ☐ Select the next flashcard by clicking the button. Then try using spacebar to flip the card. The next card is shown.
        This is due to the button capturing focus and the spacebar is pressing it instead of flipping the card.
  Flashcard Create / Edit:
    ☐ Prompt users before leaving if not saved (similar to note page)
  Chat:
    ☐ When user changes their profile picture, the old image is deleted but we still need the image at the old url.
      Need to make sure I am uploading to the same url not creating a new one

Vuex Store:
  ☐ Save the number of unread messages to the store.
    Reset the number when the user opens the chat sidebar

Agenda:
  ☐ Write agenda rules in firebase @critical
  ☐ Should old events be purged when they expire?
    - Feel that the agenda would be too cluttered over time without it
    - Could possible have a load previous button...
  ☐ Create new event input box should expand to the text's length
  ☐ Notifications?
  ☐ Reduce page title split between action buttons

Homepage:
  ☐ Display an empty placeholder if the user doesn't have any recent notes or flaschards.
  ☐ Think of better design for dashboard and homepage
    - The current design feels cluttered not very useful.

Members Page:
  ☐ Add members list page sort filters
    - Joined Date, Alphabetical, etc...
  ☐ Fix plus icon scaling and positioning

Profile Settings:
  ☐ When I implement the account deletion make sure to remove the photos as well as the user account
  ☐ Automatically update to the file picker's picture so user can preview what it will look like @low
  ☐ Create a placeholder for when the user doesn't have any study groups. Don't just show an empty table

Side Bar:
  ☐ Add more Study Group information (meeting time, location, extra info) possibly do this in a modal

NavBar:
  ☐ Redesign navbar to scale properly on all screen sizes. Employ the use of a custom flexbox setup that allows more flexibility
    Maybe a complete redesign or maybe just some improvements
  ☐ Style the currently active group dropdown based on the route parameters

Create Study Group:
  ☐ Add transitions to make it look nice
  ☐ Put a conditional on the meeting days and times. Ask "Does the have designated meeting days and times?"
  ☐ Maybe split the code into pieces to make it more manageble...

Flashcards Collection:
  ☐ Display a "deck standing" color indicator to show whether the flashcard deck is good or bad
  ☐ Use the avatar component or show the user's initials if they don't have a profile picture.

  ☐ Autofocus after using keybind to create a new flashcard
  ☐ Extract firebase functions to a separate file to be reused.... @high

Animations / Transitions:
  Create Page:
    ☐ Animation when steps indicator changes
    ☐ Animation when user navigates between cards

Possible Features (Time Permitting):
  ☐ Maybe allow users to upload pdfs and save notes to their own documents
  ☐ Video/Audio Chat with WebRTC
  ☐ Make the site mobile friendly.
    Hardest part is making the navbar change into a mobile form.
  ☐ Indicators that show online group members in the sidebar
  ☐ User chooses a gradient for their specific study group during creation
  ☐ Add emoji menu to the study group chat.
  ☐ Generate SSR with Nuxt.js. Server side rendering
