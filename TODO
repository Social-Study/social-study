Branding:
  ☐ Design a logo / titlebar icon
  ☐ Think of better slogan.
  ☐ The new titlebar icon only apply to the google redirect popup window but now the title bar?

Database Design:
  ☐ May have to mess with the structure of the database. I need to update the database a user is joining. Changed the rules to allow any authenticated user to modify the study group but there has to be a better way to do it.
    May have to put the members list in a separate location or something.
    Might implement a public facing version...
  ☐ Not sure if the user's study groups need to be stored in their profile, I can just query the "study-group" collection for all groups with the users id in the member array
  ☐ Figure out how to delete a code after 24 hours.
    May just have it set so that when a new user requests a code, the cloud functions deletes any old codes that are older than 24 hours old
General:
  ☐ Not sure why the favicon is not showing????
  ☐ Make sure the build bundle size is not too large.
  ☐ Font-Awesome Icon Package Icons are not aligned properly
    ☐ Get rid of vueawesome and use cdn to reduce package size and wierd errors
  ☐ Go through an error check all inputs where necessary
  ☐ Create a universal notifaction popup, not like the homepage error notifcation but a bubble type.
  ☐ Extract common firebase function calls to an outside file
    ☐ Generate Code
  ☐ Add sidebar icons
  ☐ The vuex store requires the vuex-persist plugin to save to the computers local storage. I think this is a bad thing and we should try to stop using it. The firebase state should be saved to the session so idk what's going on.
  ☐ When the page content overflows downwards, only allow the page content to scroll not the sidebar or header
    Not exactly sure how to do this.
  ☐ find new animation library
  ☐ add dark blur effect to modals

Components Needed:
  ☐ Notification popup
  ☐ Small info modal?

Vuex Store:
  ☐ Only save the uid to local storage

Homepage:
  ☐ Add homepage option to list and remove active invite codes.
  ☐ Add more detail to Study Group cards in dropdown

Members Page:
  ☐ Add members list page sort filters
    - Joined Date, Alphabetical, etc...

Profile Settings:
  ☐ When I implement the account deletion make sure to remove the photos as well as the user account
  ☐ Automatically update to the file picker's picture so user can preview what it will look like

Routing:
  Bugs:
    ☐ User refreshes page after being redirected and it takes them back to landing, it should prevent them from seeing the landing while logged in
    ☐ Setup firebase auth to not allow users to see the page that aren't in the study group's auth list
    ☐ User list should auto update when a new user joins the group

Side Bar:
  ☐ add more Study Group information (meeting time, location, extra info) possibly do this in a modal


Study Group:
  ☐ Show a study group settings modal only to the group owner to allow them to change the details after creation

Create Study Group:
  ☐ Prevent user from clicking create and getting to copy code if they don't do all steps
  ☐ Add validation on the inputs
  ☐ Add transitions to make it look nice
  ☐ Revert back to Spectre.css
    - Element is too opinionated, and it is a pain in the ass trying to override most of the defaults
    - It is also very large, > 1mb
  ☐ Change steps so that the one before the end is the finish


Flashcards:
  ☐ Implement navigation animations
  ✔ Implement keyboard controls @done(18-12-12 19:33)
  ☐ Implement firebase functionality
  ☐ find a way to better indicate which side of the flashcard is currently displaying

Prototype Presentation:
  ☐ Implement a Study Group feature
    ✔ Flashcards @done(18-12-12 19:32)
