Branding:
  ☐ Design a logo / titlebar icon
  ☐ Think of better slogan.

Database Design:
  ☐ Does the user's photoURL need to be stored in the firestore for other users to view it?
General:
  ☐ Convert Project to new Element UI Library
  ☐ Make sure the build bundle size is not too large.
  ☐ Font-Awesome Icon Package Icons are not aligned properly
  ☐ Figure out the sizing issues, I want body to be entire screen height but exclude the nav bar...

Routing:
  Bugs:
    ☐ User refreshes page after being redirected and it takes them back to landing, it should prevent them from seeing the landing while logged in
    ☐ Setup firebase auth to not allow users to see the page that aren't in the study group's auth list

Dashboard:
  ☐ When you update your profile picture, you must refresh page to see it
    - Might have something to do with the photoURL being stored in auth not firestore

Study Group Creation:
  ☐ The TimePicker component's time indicator seems to be offset for some reason. The lines don't surround the currently selected time

Prototype Presentation:
  ☐ Implement Study Groups
    ☐ Figure out how routing will work
  ☐ Implement a Study Group feature
    ☐ Flashcards
