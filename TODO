Branding:
  ☐ Design a logo / titlebar icon
  ☐ Think of better slogan.

  ☐ Find better flashcard sidebar icon

Database Design:
☐ General:
  ☐ Not sure why the favicon is not showing???? @low
  ☐ Make sure the build bundle size is not too large. @low
  ☐ Go through an error check all inputs where necessary

  ☐ When the page content overflows downwards, only allow the page content to scroll not the sidebar or header @high
    Not exactly sure how to do this.
  ☐ find new animation library
    - Cannot apply the blur effect because it requires backdrop-filter that is only available in certain browsers
  ☐ Maybe allow users to upload pdfs and save notes to their own documents

Components Needed:
  ☐ Notification popup
    Currently using vue-notifications but would be willing to switch to something better.
  ☐ Modal that can be used for all other modals.
  ☐ Custom designed switch component

Study Group Settings:

NavBar:
  ☐ Upgrade navbar dropdown to look more like the figma design. Each class should provide some details @today
