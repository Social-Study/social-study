Branding:
  ☐ Design a logo / titlebar icon
  ☐ Think of better slogan.
  ☐ The new titlebar icon only apply to the google redirect popup window but now the title bar?

Database Design:
  ✔ Does the user's photoURL need to be stored in the firestore for other users to view it? @done(18-12-08 23:38)
  ☐ Not sure if the user's study groups need to be stored in their profile, I can just query the "study-group" collection for all groups with the users id in the member array
  ☐ Implement Study Group Invite Code Logic...
  ☐ Figure out how to delete a code after 24 hours.
    - May just have it set so that when a new user requests a code, the cloud functions deletes any old codes that are older than 24 hours old
General:
  ☐ Convert Project to new Element UI Library
  ☐ Make sure the build bundle size is not too large.
  ☐ Font-Awesome Icon Package Icons are not aligned properly
  ☐ Figure out the sizing issues, I want body to be entire screen height but exclude the nav bar...

Profile Settings:
  ☐ Make sure to delete/overwrite old profile picture when someone changes theirs
  ☐ Automatically update to the file picker's picture so user can preview what it will look like
  ☐ Add Study Groups tab so users can remove study groups from their account
  ✔ Not sure how I can get the profile picture to automatically update when they change it @done(18-12-08 23:39)

Routing:
  Bugs:
    ☐ User refreshes page after being redirected and it takes them back to landing, it should prevent them from seeing the landing while logged in
    ☐ Setup firebase auth to not allow users to see the page that aren't in the study group's auth list

NavBar:
  ✔ Make the navbar manage it's own state from firebase @done(18-12-08 22:56)
  ☐ Implement the dropdown menus and create study group buttons

Dashboard:
  ✔ When you update your profile picture, you must refresh page to see it @done(18-12-08 22:56)
    - Might have something to do with the photoURL being stored in auth not firestore

Create Study Group:
  ☐ Add validation on the inputs
  ☐ Add transitions to make it look nice
  ☐ Revert back to Spectre.css
    - Element is too opinionated, and it is a pain in the ass trying to override most of the defaults

Prototype Presentation:
  ✔ Implement Study Groups @done(18-12-08 22:55)
    ✔ Figure out how routing will work @done(18-12-08 22:55)
  ☐ Implement a Study Group feature
    ☐ Flashcards
